# CubeCart < 6.5.5 - Authenticated File Upload May Lead To RCE (CVE-2024-33438)

## TL;DR

Although the application prevents most PHP extensions (e.g. `.php`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.phtml`, etc) from being uploaded to the web server, the `.phar` extension is not blocked. An authenticated user with “edit” permissions to CubeCart’s file manager can upload a web shell via File Manager > Images and execute commands remotely.
