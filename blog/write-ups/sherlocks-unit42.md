# Unit42

## Introduction

<p>Unit42 is a "Very Easy" challenge We have the following scenario: "In this Sherlock, you will familiarize yourself with Sysmon logs and various useful EventIDs for identifying and analyzing malicious activities on a Windows system. Palo Alto's Unit42 recently conducted research on an UltraVNC campaign, wherein attackers utilized a backdoored version of UltraVNC to maintain access to systems. This lab is inspired by that campaign and guides participants through the initial access stage of the campaign."</p>
<p>We need to download a file called "unit42.zip". After decompressing it, we get a file called "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational.evtx".</p>
